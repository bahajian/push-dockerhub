# TheDatabaseMe Cookbooks

This repository hold a collection of handy scripts, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes
manifests and much more. Some of these cookbooks are described in more detail within my
[Blog](https://thedatabaseme.de). You are happily invitet to step by and leave a comment
there.

There might be a specific README within the sub directories with more details.

## ⚙️ Ansible

Within the `ansible` subfolder, you will find templates, playbooks and also some roles
maybe down the line.

## 🐳 Docker

Some Docker manifests / docker-compose(s) can be found under the `docker` sub directory.

## 👹 Jinja

Some nice examples of the Jinja2 templating engine can be found under the `jinja2` folder.

A (in my opinion) good online Jinja parser, can be found [here(http://jinja.quantprogramming.com/)]

## 🎡 Kubernetes

Some Kubernetes manifests and templates can be found under the `kubernetes` sub directory.

## 📃 Scripts

As the name says, there are some handy scripts for several topics, that can be found under
the `scripts` folder.

## 🔷 Vagrant

Some Vagrant examples can be found within the `vagrant` subfolder. Also there are some
integrations with Vagrant and Ansible there.

## 📚 Oracle

Collection of sidenotes for Oracle blog tutorials.
